Ruby port of Varnish.

Ok, it's slow. Probably not worth it. But I'm leaving this code here for the hell of it.

Some stats when testing a hello world sinatra app.

ab -c 20 -n 1000 'http://127.0.0.1:*/'

Directyl accessing the app:
Requests per second:    557.17 [#/sec] (mean)

Using Sheen:
Requests per second:    887.52 [#/sec] (mean)

Using Varnish:
Requests per second:    5120.01 [#/sec] (mean)
